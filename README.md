# Sonar-Detection-Rock-vs.-Mine-Classification
 This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on sonar frequency readings and optimized for high accuracy.  Key Features Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and splits data into training and testing sets. Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize performance. Performance Evaluation: Calculates accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model quality. Prediction Function: Accepts new sonar readings and predicts whether the object is a rock or a mine. Visualization: Includes confusion matrix heatmaps and accuracy comparison graphs for better interpretability. Technology Used Languages & Libraries Python Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, GridSearchCV, Evaluation Metrics) Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling & Processing) Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualizatio
